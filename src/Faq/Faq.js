                    Shipping cost is calculated on a "per order," "per item" or
                    "per pound" basis and is based on the shipping option you
                    select. We sometimes offer free shipping for specific
                    shipping options in select categories, or free shipping
                    sitewide.

                    You can see each product's estimated arrival date on the
                    product page and during the checkout process. During
                    checkout, you can choose an estimated arrival date from the
                    options provided.

                    You can change your shipping options as long as we haven’t
                    started the shipping process. This is usually within 30
                    minutes of placing your order. (During our busy holiday
                    season, it might be shorter.)
